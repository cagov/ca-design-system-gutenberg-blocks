# CHANGELOG for ds-content-navigation
`ds-content-navigation`

# 1.0.6
* Changed content navigation border color to Gray-300.
# 1.0.5
* Removed sticky position since it caused scroll to target positioning bug.
# 1.0.4
* Made content navigation sticky (Request came from cannabis project issue #234). To do: need to highlight nav items based on the h2 # or section, which user is scrolling through.
# 1.0.3
* Reorganized sass file. Added border bottom to all list items and border top to the first child only. (Request came from cannabis project issue #223)
