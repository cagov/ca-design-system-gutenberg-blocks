# Gutenberg Blocks for the California Design System from ca.gov





### Add a new block or pattern
* Blocks should be created one per design system component. Patterns are more extensive and could become their own separate plugin. Patterns include Gutenberg Patterns as well as content types, REST API integration for headless rendering. 
* To develop ES6 UI interfaces, register the block.js file and run `npm run build` to compile before release.
