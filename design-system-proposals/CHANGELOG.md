# Changelog

## 1.0.0
* Pull out plugin components that are not yet part of the California Design System. We can show how a component can move from a specific domain, through the CA Design System proposal process, and then how to update the design-system, then communicate with a project about future releases of the plugin code.
* Provide an example plugin for covid19.ca.gov, drought.ca.gov and digital.ca.gov to use for project specific Gutenberg blocks and patterns.
